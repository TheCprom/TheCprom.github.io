			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> I am 4th Year Computing with Software Development student in TUD Tallaght who has had an interest in all things computing since a young age.</p>
				<p> I started at TUD Tallaght straight out of college back in 2016 and have since developed numerous programs in college using Java, C++, C# and SQL I am a Highly motivated computing student who displays a willingness to learn and gain an understanding of today’s ICT environment. Interested in leveraging personal strengths such as teamwork, time management and my technical skills to make a positive contribution to any organization, while also gaining valuable industry knowledge.</p>
				<p> In 2016 – 2018 I obtained my Higher Certificate in Computing with Software Development. After this I decided to take a gap year for health reason explained in more detail below.
				<p> Info Regarding 2018/2019 Gap Year: I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Scoliosis in 2014, my condition worsened as I grew through my teenage years, resulting in me deciding to go through with major Spinal Correction Surgery in Sept 2018. It was necessary to take 12-18 months off from my studies in Software Development to focus on the major surgery and recovery. My prognosis is good, and I fully recovered, and am even more focused and determined to finish my studies and get more valuable experience in the area. </p>
				<p> Since then I have returned to my studies, completed 3rd year and am working towards obtaining my degree and finishing my final year.
